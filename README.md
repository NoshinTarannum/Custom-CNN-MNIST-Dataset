The MNIST database, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a large database of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The dataset is readily divided into a training set and a test set such that it contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau.
